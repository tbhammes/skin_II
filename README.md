# skin_II
e-textile final project

I imagine getting up in the morning and putting on my favorite layer of skin which i fabricated for myself for awarenesss and protection. I zip up this new skin to activate. This activation of my skin can be a nice pick-me-up in the morning, or perhaps some mood lighting in the evening. Maybe i just have one side of my skin activated, maybe i feel safe and my skin can rest. Perhaps i get caught in the night or there is no light in sight, where this allows as a warning mechanism to others.
